# Adinkra Symbol Recognition

Overview

This project is an AI-powered web application that recognizes Adinkra symbols using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Users can upload an image of an Adinkra symbol, and the system will classify it and display its meaning.

Features

Deep Learning Model: Trained using TensorFlow/Keras to recognize different Adinkra symbols.

Flask Backend: Serves the model and handles image classification.

React Frontend: Provides a user-friendly interface for uploading and classifying images.

Git LFS Support: Manages large model files efficiently.
